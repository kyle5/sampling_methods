\section{ Spatial sampling }
% Show the reason that indices are likely to converge to a set of locations over and over again...
The current spatial sampling method simply focuses on iteratively moving points to locations that are far away from all other points. <List the iterative scoring method to maximize>
% show no real increase in performance for apple datasets

\subsection{ Direct Extrapolation: No Sensor Data }
All of our sampling methods are based on a process that starts with initially sampling groundtruth data. In this section, the results show that simply extrapolating this groundtruth subsample measurement can gain accuracy that is greater than scaling the sensor data.

% apple
For the apple datasets, it is seen that adding sensor data does in fact add accuracy. This is seen for both Granny Smith and Red Delicious apple datasets.

\end{figure}

% grape
For the grape datasets, direct extrapolation of the groundtruth is more effective than using sensor data. It is worth remembering that the sensor data would still provide dense image measurements that would be lost with a direct groundtruth extrapolation approach.

This phenomenon is explained by the linear offset apparent in grape datasets described in the next section.

\subsection{ Sampling: Scaling with a linear function }
Instead of scaling with a scalar value, a linear scaling function can be obtained by doing linear regression on the subsample data collected. With this function, sensor data can be mapped to predicted yield in a more dynamic way.

% example of better performance
% grape
A linear function is seen to be effective for grape datasets.

% example of no improvement
% apple
A linear function is seen to be ineffective for apple datasets.
\begin{figure}

\parbox{7cm}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

This suggests that there are some systematic differences between apple detection and grape detection. This is logical as the grape code includes features that the apple code does not, such as initial detection clustering.
