Could organize the data as a cell array -> Convert back to MATLAB in the end

Could have another section to compute extra random sections
	to handle algorithm and scaling section overlap

The 6 approaches:
Unscaled/Scaled/Stratified/Spatial:
	Have random indices assigned to a local variable
	Have scaling factor assigned to a local variable
Kriging:
	Have random indices
	Get all of the other possible indices
Standard Deviation:
	(
	Get algorithm counts
		Get the sections that are optimal for scaling factor
		Compute scaling factor
	)
	Still just a scaling factor and indices should be setup with the other 4


Setting up indices:
	Current:
	
	unscaled/scaled/stratified choose random indices
		unscaled/scaled:
			Just uses the random sections that are initial chosen
		stratified:
