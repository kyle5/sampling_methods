                       Farthest-Point Optimization
                              Example Code

This example code implements the optimization method proposed in the paper
  T. Schl√∂mer, D. Heck, O. Deussen:
  Farthest-Point Optimized Point Sets with Maximized Minimum Distance
  HPG '11: High Performance Graphics Proceedings
 
Requirements:
  CGAL 3.7 or higher (www.cgal.org)

Usage:
  The included Makefile creates a single executable 'fpo' provided CGAL is
  already installed. Adjust the INC and LIB variables in the Makefile to set
  the required header and library search paths if necessary.

  By default, the program optimizes a random set of 1024 points until a
  relative minimum distance of 0.925 is achieved. The resulting point
  distribution is written to an EPS file.
  
  Run
    ./fpo --help
  to obtain an overview of available command line options.
