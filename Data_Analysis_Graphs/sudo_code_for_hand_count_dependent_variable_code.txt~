// sudo code for the new process

Notes:
Organize the data by which variable is dependent
	

setup the variables needed beforehand
	setup the number of:
		algorithm count indices
		ground count indices
	cell arrays for each type
	
	loops are always connected with ground or algorithm counts
		data is computed the same way
		the indices to save data to vary

	adjustment of indices could either occur for alg or hand counts
		C code to do this would be straight forward
			would take a day to write

	error value calculation would be the same

	save data to indices specified
		there should be an efficient way to accomplish this
			reshaping the matrix
